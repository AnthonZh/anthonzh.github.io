                        Beyond the Sky LLC was established in 2053 by Dr. Anson Wang. While experimenting with engineering in his local high school's Technology Student Association, Wang built his first-ever rocket. Shortly after, he founded Beyond the Sky, which has blasted off ever since. Now, with a fleet of over 20 state-of-the-art ships, Beyond the Sky has the honor of taking your crew wherever your hearts desire.
